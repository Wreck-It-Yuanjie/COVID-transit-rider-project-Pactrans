# Lost transit riders in the post-pandemic era: who and where?

## Abstract
Welcome to our Lost transit rider project (2020-2021)!

We surveyed residents of the Puget Sound, Washington region about their travel habits before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and expectations for post-pandemic. We identified six groups of respondents characterized by their transit use frequency before, during, and after the pandemic. We focus primarily on the group lost riders: those who used transit frequently pre-pandemic but expect to ride less post-pandemic. They account for 28% of transit riders in our sample. Compared with rebounding frequent riders, who expect to return to heavy transit use post-pandemic, lost transit riders are older and wealthier; no significant attitudinal differences towards taking transit are found between two groups. Though would not return to transit post-pandemic, lost riders would not switch to other travel modes either. Instead, they expect to reduce travel frequency by 3.4 days per week, mainly due to increasing working from home (WFH) frequency by 1.6 days per week, on average.
